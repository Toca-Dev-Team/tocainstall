# TocaInstall
> **The official, proprietary system installer for Toca Linux.**

TocaInstall is the core deployment engine designed specifically for Toca Linux. It provides a seamless, secure, and reliable installation experience, ensuring that the operating system is perfectly configured from the first boot.

## Overview

TocaInstall is an internal project developed by the **Toca Dev Team**. It is built to handle partition management, system imaging, and initial environment setup with precision. Unlike general-purpose installers, TocaInstall is deeply integrated with the Toca Linux architecture.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Deployment**: Tailored specifically for the Toca Linux filesystem structure.
- **Hardware Integration**: Smart detection of system components for driver pre-configuration.
- **Security-First**: Integrated encryption options during the installation process.
- **Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight execution to ensure compatibility even on resource-constrained hardware.

## Installation & Usage

TocaInstall is intended to be executed only from the **Toca Linux Live Media**. 

Internal components and scripts are not meant to be run manually on existing systems. Unauthorized execution or integration into other distributions is strictly prohibited.
